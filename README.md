## Project Overview

This project investigates the interaction between long-term U.S. Treasuries (TLT), short-term Treasuries (SHY), and equities (SPY) to understand yield curve dynamics and their impact on relative asset performance.

The core hypothesis is that the slope of the yield curve (difference between long- and short-term rates) can be used as a signal for bond market relative value trades, and potentially as a macroeconomic indicator for equities.

**Key Concepts:**

- **TLT** (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) → proxy for long-duration Treasuries.

- **SHY** (iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF) → proxy for short-duration Treasuries.

- **SPY** (S&P 500 ETF) → benchmark for equity performance.

- **Yield Curve Steepening**: Long-term yields rise relative to short-term yields → long bonds underperform.

- **Yield Curve Flattening**: Long-term yields fall relative to short-term yields → long bonds outperform.


**Research Goals**

- Quantify the relationship between yield curve changes and TLT vs. SHY relative performance.

- Compare volatility and correlations across bonds and equities.

- Evaluate historical performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdowns, Calmar ratio).

- Conduct regime-based analysis (inversions, steep/flat regimes) to explore predictive relationships.
